\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces  Diagram of vertices of interest for the contradiction proofs of case 1, 2(3) and 4. Figures (a) of each case represent the current disposition of $M_E$ with the contradiction hypothesis ($c(v) = R, c(p) = R, (v,p)\in G.E$). Figures (b) show how this extra edge leads to a contradiction. Black edges are matching edges; Green edges are not matching edges; The color of the vertices represent which set they belong to; In case 4 the doted/solid vertices are used to separate the two zig-zags. \relax }}{5}}
